*Based on the Textmate theme by Minimal Design LLC found [here]
(http://minimaldesign.net/downloads/tools/textmate-theme).*

Autumnal browns and oranges that are very easy on the eye, yet contains many
practical features like current line highlighting and a darker background for
embedded code blocks (eg. JavaScript within HTML).
